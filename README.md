# Cryptocurrencies

The purpose of the repository:

To understand what unsupervised learning is used for, how to process data, how to cluster, how to reduce the dimensions, and how to reduce the principal components using PCA.

The description of what was accomplished:

Created a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new cryptocurrency investment portfolio.

We did this in four steps:
1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
